# Elemental Warrior Game - Complete Game Mechanics Description

## üéÆ **Core Game Concept**
Elemental Warrior is an educational platformer game that combines elemental combat mechanics with mathematical problem-solving. Players control a warrior who must navigate through futuristic city levels while defeating robots using the correct elemental powers and solving math problems to gain advantages.

## ‚öîÔ∏è **Elemental Combat System**
